Nazi Quarter Expelled
By Editors of the AT
Op-ed

For months one entity has pushes the boundaries of Mount Augusta's diverse and accepting culture. Their most prominent figureheads, Figasaur, and Cr0c0dile/Zoltan actively put on jewish caricatures in order to show jews as snobbish, greedy, and lawyer-like. In addition, they frequently act toxicly toward members of the community. In fact, in the ongoing trial "Godomasta vs. Figasaur" comped, Olivay, stardarkness, jonass, and stardarkness have all attested to their "degrading" character. The Quarter had been the center of controversy to such an extent that it has been "obby bombed" with IRO at least four times. One player, MrUnderhill_ obby bombed them four months ago, and subsequently made a post titled "I griefed the JQ". They remarked in their post, "The 'JQ's' chief rabbi" is known for being an actual, real-life neo-Nazi who marched in Charlottesville." and went on to justify their measure "Everything about their behaviour insults me, and my blood boils when I see them in action. I had nothing to lose, so I spoke up for all of Augusta."
