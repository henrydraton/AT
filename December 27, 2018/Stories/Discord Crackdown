MtA Discord Crackdown
By citylion

Late last night, December 26th 2018, there was a crackdown in the MtA discord in an attempt to remove the NSFW channel. User Trevie303 was quick to point out that they had lost access to the channel in #general. Trevie303 then posted an invite to an inappropriate NSFW discord, and was accordingly contained for breaking rule three/four of the discord, which disallows posting NSFW/weeb/furry/anime content outside of their proper channels. Some players raised concerns about the fact that there are minors in the discord, while others assert that there is no reason to have NSFW content in the community. Early this morning on the 27th the NSFW channel was reinstated, but later taken back down by mayor Godomasta. He went on to state, "I'll remove it, if a lot of people complain about it then I'll re-add it". The discord moderators announced that Trevie303 will be uncontained within a week.
