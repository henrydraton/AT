A Trip to Pripyat
By HenryDraton

Today, I went to Pripyat. Pripyat is one of the most pleasent cities on Earth. As you walk around irradiated craters and boarded up buildings, you will come to love this city as its own citizens have. There is a sense of individuality and detail to every single sign and potted plant. For example, the main park in the middle of the city features boiling water pits: the magma blocks underneath the surface of the ponds occassionally evaporate the water blocks above them, emitting a nice particle and sound effect. Another great example is Black Mesa: a gigantic, secret, underground research facility located beneath the mesa biome that constitutes Pripyat. Do some work inside the gigantic sprawling industrial complex by running on treadmills that power fuel to vodka refineries! Additionally, there is the museum for which Romec is famous for. His exhibit on intergalatic teletype machines is a marvel of modern engineering. Assembled by him using a series of pistons, armored stands, item frames, and various other pieces of machinery it is a shocking synthesis of Civcraft art and engineering. Finally, there is the power plant itself: see reactor #4 and the Elephant's Foot! You can irradiate yourself and join the mutants. Or don't! Pripyat's story is a remarkable one and the best way to experience it is to go there and check it out for yourself. The town is located at 6175, 2350 and is accessible via various railways from SPQR, Mount Augusta, and Threepton.
