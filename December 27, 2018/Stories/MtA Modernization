Central MtA Modernization
by citylion

Over the last month central Mount Augusta has seen a number of additions and improvements. Late last November construction for a new railstation was implemented by HenryDraton using a new and improved dual dial system which now supports up to 64 rail connections. The new design works like a telephone, on one side of the station is a directory containing a list of inputs into the dials with their respective destinations. Players can still quickly choose their station in the new design without having to pace through a large staton searching for their tunnel. The old railstation and MAFO station were deconstructed soon after, and in its place construction of the new supertall Augusta Trade Center began. The tower is nearing completion, soon a spire and upgraded lobby will be built. Under the tower, a new MAFO room and garden have been added, and renovations for a secure bunker hosting more expensive factories are underway. Aside from the Augusta Trade Center, or ATC, the skyline is changing daily, with a brand new revamped GNI tower from Godomasta, progress on Njordomir's tower, a nearly finished bedrock to sky limit MACRO tower by PatrickBateman_ , as well as a Hibachi Grill/casino on HenryDraton's former Manor plot. Mount Augusta's transportation network is still seeing improvements. New lines to Pripyat and Aurora soon wil be connected, and a tunnel into the station from the mall and ATC has been added.
