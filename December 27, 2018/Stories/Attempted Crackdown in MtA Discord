Attempted Crackdown in MtA Discord
By citylion

 Late last night, December 26th 2018, there was a crackdown in the MtA discord in an attempt to remove the NSFW channel. After posting an invite to an inappropriate discord, user twevie was contained for breaking rule three/four of the discord, which disallows posting NSFW/weeb/furry/anime content outside of their proper channels.
